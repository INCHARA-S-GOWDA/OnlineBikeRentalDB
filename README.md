# OnlineBikeRentalDB
The concept of Bike Rental Database is vast by itself. The bike rental data set is a
classic data analytics problem. It is set in the context of bike sharing system where users can
rent a bike at Location A and return it at Location B. The
whole objective of this project is to provide the user a streamlined experience to access and 
fetch the details of their respective bookings. This system has only one admin account and 
cannot have more than one admin account.
